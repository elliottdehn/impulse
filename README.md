# impulse
Simple 2D game made purely in Flutter using MVP design (inspired by medicine)

# how the game works
Users are flashed a symbol, and are expected to respond within a certain time frame by tapping the screen. If the user does not tap in time, they lose. If the user taps again, prior to the next symbol being flashed, they lose. If the user taps a special symbol (the letter X, for now), they lose.

The game tests the user's impulse control, patience, working memory, focus, reaction time, and comprehension rate. It also gets harder as the game progresses.
